\section{Experience}

\cventry{Jul. 2018--Present}{Proprietor}{R. King Data Consulting}{Davis, CA}{}
{Sole proprietor providing services in data analysis, data science, and data systems, targeting NGOs, non-profits, researchers, and early stage startups. Built custom solutions for clients that increase access to quality information, modernize data collection and analysis infrastructure, and produce concrete organizational gains. }

\cventry{Nov. 2016--Jul. 2018}{Data Operations  and Technology Strategist}{Education Analytics}{Remote employee for Non-profit based in Madison, WI}{}
{Technical support and advocate for the Analyst Team as EA grows as an organization and individual projects become more diverse in their technological requisites. Manage and guide the computation and data science infrastructure: R, RStudio, Python, Linux servers, and all database development. Directly support projects with more complex technical needs:  design and implement meachine learning models, design and build high availability computational databases and data warehouses, write python and R packages to ease access of internal data stores, guide pipeline and process development in complex projects}

\cventry{Apr. 2015--Nov. 2016}{Programmer Analyst}{Value Added Research Center}{University of Wisconsin, Madison Education Research Center}{}{Implement complex statistical models with SAS and R, perform research on predicting models for student behaviors and abilities, proposed and implemented unsupervised learning methods for tracking complex student trajectories. 
}
\cventry{Oct. 2014--Dec. 2016}{Software Developer}{UC Davis Agricultural Innovation Project}{Remote}{}{Proposed, designed, and built \href{http://ucd-ipo.github.io/agroft/}{Agroft}: an open source statistics web application to help agriculture researchers in Pakistan analyze data from field trials and learn R. Written in R.  
}
