# About Me

I am a graduate of UC Davis with a B.S. degree in psychology and statistics. I've worked conducting data analysis and building data systems in fields as diverse as Healthcare, Agriculture, Education, and Genomics. In the past I've been a Data Scientist, a DBA, a DevOps Engineer, a Researcher, a Software Developer, and a Linux Systems Admin, but I find I operate best when I blur the lines  between all those roles. I'm deeply devoted to utilizing data for social good, and strive to work with like minded people.

I'm passionate about social and economic justice, open access to information, and using technological advancements in data collection, management, and analysis, to create measurable positive change. 

My [resume](www/src/resume.pdf) offers more information on my educational and vocational history. My (rarely updated) [personal website](http://ikkyle.com) offers a look into some topics that were of interest to me years ago, but was mostly created as a tool to learn about managing remote servers and to have access to my development environments (Rstudio server, Jupyter) from any computer, and my embarrassingly candid blog [fauxktrends](http://fauxktrends.tumblr.com/archive) offers a view into a web scraping and analysis project I found engaging several years ago. I link to it not because it is terribly impressive or engaging, but to remind myself that the past informs the future, and forgetting about the past (purposefully or not), means we will be doomed to repeat it*. 

\*An issue that comes up often in building models, mathematical or otherwise, as it is so easy and can be so damaging to encode historical biases in our models. 

# Past Work

Regrettably, many of the projects I've worked on that I am most proud of live behind closed doors, due to the sensitivity of the data I work with and employer policies. What follows are some projects I've worked on. Many are hobbies entirely unrelated to my substantive interests, but a few gems offer some real value. 

## Agroft
## Dating Site Analysis

I spent some time scraping a popular dating site (I'll call it "OKStupid") in an attempt to practice extracting info from diverse samples and increase my skills in interactive data visualization, text mining and web-scraping. Below are links to notebooks that show my scraping and munging proccess, as well as some of the more interesting analyses I've done.
